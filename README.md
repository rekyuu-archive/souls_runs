# SoulsRuns

- The convenant, weapon, and armor set must all be obtained as quickly as possible and must be used for the majority of the run (that means killing Dancer before Vordt if needed).
  - You may use any weapon and armor before then as long as you get to the listed ones ASAP.
- If you are using spells you may not use anything than what is listed above, which is why a secondary weapon is listed for balance.
- You must get all collectable key items and use them accordingly before the end of the run if possible.
  - For instance, if you get the Lift Key you must also defeat the Darkwraith, if you get a Scroll you must turn it in, etc.
- Anything else (consumables, rings, etc) are completely up to the player.
- Any% or All Bosses is up to the player.
